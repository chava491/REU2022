Authors: Salvador Guel and Dr. Anthony Parolari

Description (As of 6/27/22):

  a) The following code is able to download a tab-seperated file from the internet. It then checks to make sure taht the download was correct and then saves that to a file. This file is read, but all the lines that do not matter are deleted. Thus, we read in the needed data into a seperate file to then be able to extract the data back into python as arrays and variables that can be directly refered to.
